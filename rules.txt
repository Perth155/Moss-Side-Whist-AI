Moss Side Whist uses a standard deck of 52 cards, with suits Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades, and face values 2-10, Jack, Queen King and Ace.
Moss Side Whist is played between three players. The order of play is:
Two players are dealt 16 cards each and the third player (the leader) is dealt 20.
The leader examines their cards and chooses 4 cards to discard. These cards are not seen by the other players.
They then play 16 tricks, with the leader going first in the first trick. Each trick goes as follows:
The first player lays one of their cards face up on the table.
The player to their left lays a card face up on the table. If they have any cards that are the suit as the leaders card, they must play a card of the same suit. Otherwise they can play any card they choose.
The last player lays a card face up on the table. Again, they must follow the first players suit if they can.
The winner is the person who played the highest card. Cards of the same suit are ordered by value (with Ace being the highest, and 2 the lowest). A spade (trumps) will beat any card of a different suit. Any card that is not a spade and not the same suit as the suit of the first players card is lower than the first players card.
The winner scores a point, the played cards are removed, and the winner gets to play first in the next trick.
Play continues until all cards have been played, and then the points are tallied.
At the end of the round the leaders score is their number of points, minus eight, and the other players scores are their numbers of points, minus four.
Several rounds will be player, each time with the lead moving one place to the left. Scores are accumulated over rounds, and players aim to have the highest score.
